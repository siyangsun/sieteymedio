# Siete y Medio

The goal is to write, in C++, a single-player version of the card game known as '_siete y medio_' (seven and a half), which is similar to Blackjack. The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 7 1/2 without going over it.
The game is played with a '_Spanish baraja_', an old traditional deck of cards introduced to Spain in the 14th century. 
The goal is to create a program that will play '_siete y medio_' against the player, and keep a log of rounds played- each round will be recorded in a .txt file.
